	  <h1>Hey there!</h1>
	  <p>I am a Chirpy,young 19 year old girl and I am currently in my sophomore year in college. I am an App and Web developer and a self taught makeup artist and hairstylist too!
		  In my free time I love to code, eat random stuff or binge watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S and a bunch of youtube videos!
		  Oh and I am a bathroom singer! (I mean, who isn't!).
		  
		  I was introduced to competitive coding and developing in school and since then i've been on this never ending amazing learning curve.
		  I hope someday my contribution would help the society and I am constantly working towards acheiving that goal of mine.
